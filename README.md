<p>
FocusFlow is a structured learning platform designed to help learners, students, and professionals create and follow distraction-free learning paths. The platform provides a centralized environment where users can organize courses, track progress, and maintain focus without the distractions of traditional learning platforms.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<br/>
Modern learners face constant distractions across multiple platforms, lack structured progress tracking, and struggle to maintain consistent learning routines. Existing platforms often mix social features, recommendations, and unrelated content that disrupts the "flow state" essential for deep learning.

<h4>Solution</h4>
<br/>
FocusFlow offers a streamlined learning experience through structured course management with custom learning paths, a minimalist and distraction-free interface, visual progress tracking, integrated support for various course materials, and cross-platform access with synchronized progress across web and mobile applications.
