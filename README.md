<h3><a href="https://github.com/Mubaraklouis/hospital-management-system" target="_blank">FocusFlow</a></h3>
<p>
FocusFlow is a structured learning platform designed to help learners, students, and professionals create and follow distraction-free learning paths. The platform provides a centralized environment where users can organize courses, track progress, and maintain focus without the distractions of traditional learning platforms.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<br/>
Modern learners face constant distractions across multiple platforms, lack structured progress tracking, and struggle to maintain consistent learning routines. Existing platforms often mix social features, recommendations, and unrelated content that disrupts the "flow state" essential for deep learning.

<h4>Solution</h4>
<br/>

FocusFlow provides:
<br/>

Structured Course Management: Create custom learning paths with clear progression
Minimalist Interface: Distraction-free environment optimized for learning
Progress Tracking: Visual indicators and completion metrics
Integrated Resources: Attach various course materials (videos, articles, documents) to courses
Cross-Platform Access: Web and mobile applications with synchronized progress
